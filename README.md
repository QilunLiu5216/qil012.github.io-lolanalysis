<h1>Early-Game Metrics and Victory Correlation in League of Legends</h1>

<p>In the competitive realm of professional League of Legends, the actions taken in the early stages of a game can often determine the outcome of the entire match. This analysis probes into the 2018 season's professional matches to extract valuable insights into how early-game performances correlate with the chances of winning.</p>

<p>Our analysis, fueled by data sourced from Oracle's Elixir, scrutinizes the importance of achieving 'First Blood,' capturing dragons, and destroying the first tower. These key objectives are crucial for gaining early control and setting a precedent for the rest of the match.</p>

<p>We concentrate on several vital metrics that shape our understanding of a match's dynamics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>gameid:</b> Acts as the linchpin for our analysis, uniquely identifying each match.</li>
  <li><b>side:</b> Offers context on the starting position, which may influence the strategy for securing First Blood.</li>
  <li><b>firstblood:</b> A significant early game event that can provide both psychological and strategic advantages.</li>
  <li><b>dragons:</b> Reflects the control over neutral objectives that a team possesses.</li>
  <li><b>firsttower:</b> Signifies the initial step towards territorial dominance and map control.</li>
  <li><b>gamelength:</b> Provides a narrative on how the game's strategy played out and the ability of a team to conclude the match effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a dataset of 11,559 matches post-data cleaning, our research aims to go beyond academic analysis. We aspire to identify the key early-game objectives that play a critical role in securing victory. This research is intended to guide players and teams in enhancing their strategic play within League of Legends.</p>
